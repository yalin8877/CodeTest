Codes for some common algorithms, data structures, and some famous questions or puzzles,
which may also be helpful for an interview.

Different codes put in different folders according to its type, 
like the sort algorithms put in "Sortings" folder.

Ingnore the "test.*" and "func.*" files in the root folder, they're just for testing.

Will keep enriching the algorithms :)
